This is my version of the "**Static Node.js and Express Site**" project for **Teamtreehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree**.

Starter files in Commit 1 were provided, the rest of the code and files were created and added by myself.

CUSTOM CSS for "Exceeds Grade" (-> custom.css):

-   background-color for .sidebar (gradient)
-   color(s) for .sidebar text
-   fonf-family for .sidebar h5
-   color transition for .sidebar a on :hover
